Forward spam emails to asdfunsubscribe@gmail.com. I automatically unsubscribe you. It's that easy.

I hate spam as much as you and my mission is to rid the world of unwanted advertising. This is a donation to the good of "Inbox Zero" so there is no cost and no catch. See my commitment statement.

Provide a free and easy to use way to improve inbox cleanliness.
Do not store personal information longer than necessary, and never use it for personal gain.
Provide transparency into the code (github.com/skier31415/unsubscribe) running this service. 
Use software to unsubscribe with "best effort" quality:
  This works for emails that have an unsubscribe link in the email, and does not require a login to the service itself (LinkedIn for example). 
  The software follows the link in a simulated browser, fills out the form, and clicks the unsubscribe button.
  I can't guarantee it will always work, but this service will almost certainly improve your inbox load.
