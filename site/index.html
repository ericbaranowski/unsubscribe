    <p>I hate spam as much as you and my mission is to rid the world of unwanted advertising. This is a donation to the good of "Inbox Zero" so there is no cost and no catch. See my commitment statement.</p>
<p>Provide a free and easy to use way to improve inbox cleanliness.
<ul><li>Do not store personal information longer than necessary, and never use it for personal gain.</li>
  <li>Provide transparency into the code (github.com/skier31415/unsubscribe) running this service.</li> 
<li>Use software to unsubscribe with "best effort" quality:
<ul><li>This works for emails that have an unsubscribe link in the email, and does not require a login to the service itself (LinkedIn for example).</li>
  <li>The software follows the link in a simulated browser, fills out the form, and clicks the unsubscribe button.</li>
	<li>The marketing company may send an email "Confirmed you have unsubscribed." I hate these too, but I can't prevent it.</li>
  <li>I can't guarantee it will always work, but this service will almost certainly improve your inbox load.</li></ul></p>

<p>I am a former Google Engineer and current independent software contractor (linkedin.com/in/wdvorak).</p>
